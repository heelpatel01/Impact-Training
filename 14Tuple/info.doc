it is Immutable...means you can't change values of tuple...
and can be inser in the end only


In many programming languages, including Python, "tuple" and "list" refer to two different types of data structures with distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between tuples and lists in Python:

1. **Mutability:**
   - **List:** Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements by assigning new values, adding or removing items.
   - **Tuple:** Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be modified or changed.

2. **Syntax:**
   - **List:** Defined using square brackets `[]`.
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']
     ```
   - **Tuple:** Defined using parentheses `()`.
     ```python
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')
     ```

3. **Performance:**
   - **List:** Because lists are mutable, they may require more memory and are generally less memory-efficient compared to tuples.
   - **Tuple:** Tuples are more memory-efficient due to their immutability.

4. **Methods:**
   - **List:** Lists have more built-in methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements, such as `append()`, `remove()`, and `extend()`.
   - **Tuple:** Tuples have fewer methods since they are immutable. Common operations include `count()` and `index()`.

5. **Use Cases:**
   - **List:** Use lists when you need a collection of elements that may need to be modified during the program's execution.
   - **Tuple:** Use tuples when you want an immutable collection of elements, especially when the size and values of the elements should not change.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the differences:

```python
# List example
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']
my_list[0] = 100  # Modifying an element in the list is allowed

# Tuple example
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')
# The following line would raise an error since tuples are immutable:
# my_tuple[0] = 100
```

In summary, choose between lists and tuples based on whether you need a mutable or immutable collection of elements in your program.
